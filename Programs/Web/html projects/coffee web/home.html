      <p>
        What is House Blend Coffee meaning? House Blend: The approach that many
        successful coffee shops use is to start with a “house blend.” It's
        essentially a straight-forward “all day drinker” that is good on it's
        own and pairs well with the milk and sugar many customers will
        inevitably add
        <br />
        The degree to which a coffee bean is roasted is one of the most
        important factors that determine the taste of the coffee. Unroasted
        beans (green in color) are put into a roaster and exposed to a high
        level of heat. When the bean “cracks,” it loses its outer coating and
        releases the flavor of the bean. The longer the bean roasts, the darker
        and stronger the bean becomes. When the roasting is complete, the beans
        can be blended and ground to create distinct flavors and brews.

    <!-- Columbian Roast Coffee -->
    <h2>Columbian Roast Coffee</h2>
    <div class="columbian-roast-coffee">
      <p>
        Colombian coffee is generally a bit weaker than other coffees. Colombian
        coffee uses Arabica, generally accepted as the higher-quality coffee
        bean. The Arabica bean is a bit lighter than the Robusta, so your cup of
        Colombian coffee will typically be a bit weaker than a cup made from
        Robusta.
        <br />
        What makes Colombian coffee unique? Colombian coffee has unique flavor
        due to its growing conditions and processing methods. High-quality
        Arabica beans are grown at high altitudes. They are then processed
        naturally, by hand, on small farms.
